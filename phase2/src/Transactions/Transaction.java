 *<h1>Transaction</h1>
 *
 * This abstract class represents a meetup between two Users. <br>
 * <br><br>
 * Variables: <br>
 *
 * users: a list of users involved in the transaction. <br>
 *
 * User2 is the user that initiates the transaction. <br>
 *
 * firstMeeting: The first meeting of a transaction. <br>
 *
 * status: The possible values of this and what they mean are: <br>
 * -- "Pending" -- Status given initially while transaction is still being negotiated. <br>
 * -- "Confirmed" -- status given when details of all meetings involved in transaction has been confirmed by users. <br>
 * -- "Traded" -- first meeting has been confirmed by both users as taken place.(only used for one way) <br>
 * -- "Completed" -- the last meeting of the transaction has happened and confirmed by both users. <br>
 * -- "Cancelled" -- transaction has been cancelled. The transaction can only be in this state after pending
 *                   (too many times edited). <br>
 * -- "Incomplete" -- A user did not show at meeting 1. <br>
 * -- "Never Returned" -- A user did not show up at meeting 2 and/or items were not returned.(only used for temporary transactions). <br>
 * userStatuses: a list of all user statuses with the position in the list corresponding to the position in the list of
 * users.
